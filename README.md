# Awesome LLM (Large Language Model) CLI (Command Line Interface)

LLMs + CLI go together like peanute butter and jelly. This is a curated list of awesome command-line interfaces (CLI) for Large Language Models (LLM) and related tools.

## LLM CLI Utilities

[llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) - A CLI utility and Python library for interacting with Large Language Models, both via remote APIs and models that can be installed and run on your own machine.

[cllm](https://github.com/o3-cloud/cllm) - Command Line LLM (cllm) Toolkit is a command line tool for interfacing with LLM models. It is designed to be a simple and easy to use tool for generating text from a prompts. It includes a suite of tools for interfacing with cllm output to build more complex prompt chaining processes.

[open-interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) - Open Interpreter lets LLMs run code (Python, Javascript, Shell, and more) locally. You can chat with Open Interpreter through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running $ interpreter after installing.

[qllm](https://github.com/quantalogic/qllm) - QLLM (QuantaLogic LLM) is a powerful and flexible Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers.

[aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) - Aider lets you pair program with LLMs, to edit code in your local git repository. Start a new project or work with an existing git repo.

[tlm](https://github.com/yusufcanb/tlm) - tlm is your CLI companion which requires nothing except your workstation. It uses most efficient and powerful CodeLLaMa in your local environment to provide you the best possible command line suggestions.

## Local LLM Model Management

[ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) - Get up and running with large language models. Basically Docker for running OpenSource LLMs.

## Prompt Generation

[code2prompt](https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt?tab=readme-ov-file) - code2prompt is a command-line tool (CLI) that converts your codebase into a single LLM prompt with a source tree, prompt templating, and token counting.

[code2prompt (Python)](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/code2prompt) - Code2Prompt is a powerful command-line tool that generates comprehensive prompts from codebases, designed to streamline interactions between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for code analysis, documentation, and improvement tasks.

## Complementing CLI Utilities

[jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) - jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Works great parsing and manipulating JSON output from LLMs.

## Videos

[Language models on the command-line w/ Simon Willison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUXQNi6jQ30) - The video discusses how language models (LLMs) can be used in the Unix command-line environment to solve complex problems by integrating different tools. It showcases the potential of LLMs in processing text directly as part of pipelines.
