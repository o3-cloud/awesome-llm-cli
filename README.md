# Awesome LLM (Large Language Model) CLI (Command Line Interface)

LLMs + CLI go together like peanute butter and jelly. This is a curated list of awesome command-line interfaces (CLI) for Large Language Models (LLM) and related tools.

## LLM CLI Utilities

[llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) - A CLI utility and Python library for interacting with Large Language Models, both via remote APIs and models that can be installed and run on your own machine.

It is designed to be a simple and easy to use tool for generating text from a prompts. It includes a suite of tools for interfacing with cllm output to build more complex prompt chaining processes.

[open-interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) - Open Interpreter lets LLMs run code (Python, Javascript, Shell, and more) locally. You can chat with Open Interpreter through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running $ interpreter after installing.

## Local LLM Model Management

[ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) - Get up and running with large language models. Basically Docker for running OpenSource LLMs.

## Prompt Generation

[code2prompt](https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt?tab=readme-ov-file) - code2prompt is a command-line tool (CLI) that converts your codebase into a single LLM prompt with a source tree, prompt templating, and token counting.
